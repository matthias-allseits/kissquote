## Description / What is it good for

Since I was not happy with the platform my online-broker offers and because I like to develop, I decided to make my own platform.
Also since I own more and more positions (50+), I need to able to filter my positions by different criterias

Also I have positions where my online-broker tells me, that I am 150% in plus. But my investment is -6000 - negative - and so it is useless to show a performance percentage.

Basic concept:
* No registration
* No login
* No marketing
* No mails

Features:
* I want to see my transactions in the charts, so I am able to judge my timing(s)
* I want to now, huch much of my investment I got back from dividends over the years
* I want to label my positions for filtering purposes. For example: 'accumulate' or 'reduce', 'cyclical' or 'non-cyclical', 'strategic' or 'trade'
* I want to set my own sectors I am assigning to my positions
* I want to set different strategies I am assigning to my positions
* I want to have fundamental data about the companies behind the positions nearby
* I want to see a projection of my dividends for the future
* I want to be able to compare positions with other shares
* I want to be able to make time-warps to see what I have or what the markets have changed in my investionments
* I want to get remembered about the drawdowns of this positions in the past
* I want to have listings of my positions from different point of views:
  * Optimistic
  * Pessimistic
* I want to able to have empty positions because eventually I decide to keep the empty position in my listings after I sold off all of these shares
* I want to be able to comment my positions
* I want to have a list I call 'last-minute', where I see, what companies goes ex-dividend in the next days and weeks
* I want to have a list, what companies I have in my portfolio are reporting in the next days and weeks
* I want to be able to set a base-asset to a position and I want to set price-targets and stop-loss markers to the base-asset
